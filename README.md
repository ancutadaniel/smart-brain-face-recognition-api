You must add your own API key in the controllers/image.js file to connect to Clarifai API.
You will need a redis server and a postgreSQL server running on your machine for this to work. Connect them in your server.js based on your own details.
You can grab Clarifai API key here

\*\* Make sure you use postgreSQL instead of mySQL for this code base.
